# Knowledge Consolidation Summary

## Date: 2025-08-20

## Overview
All generic ShareDo platform documentation has been consolidated from the project root into a structured `Knowledge/` folder for better organization and accessibility.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Knowledge Folder Structure
```
Knowledge/
├── API/          # API documentation
├── UI/           # UI framework documentation  
├── Workflows/    # Workflow patterns
├── IDE/          # IDE configuration
└── README.md     # Knowledge index
```

### 2. Files Moved to Knowledge/API/
- API-REGISTRY.md
- API_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md
- SHAREDO_API_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md
- SHAREDO-API-BEST-PRACTICES.md
- Created: CONSOLIDATED_API_REFERENCE.md (new consolidated guide)

### 3. Files Moved to Knowledge/UI/
- SHAREDO-BLADE-STRUCTURE-GUIDE.md
- SHAREDO-PANEL-STACK-API.md
- ShareDo_UI_Framework_Knowledge_Base.md
- KNOWLEDGE_BASE_PANEL_COMPONENTS.md
- Element_Configuration_stackModel.md
- SHAREDO_UI_CONTEXT.md (copied from BladeBouncer)

### 4. Files Moved to Knowledge/Workflows/
- WORKFLOW-TEMPLATE-GUIDE.md (copied from AdviceManagement)

### 5. Files Moved to Knowledge/IDE/
- SHAREDO-IDE-REFERENCE.md
- SHAREDO-VSCODE-EXTENSION.md

### 6. Files Archived to _Archive/
- Original WORKFLOW-TEMPLATE-GUIDE.md (from AdviceManagement)
- Original SHAREDO_UI_CONTEXT.md (from BladeBouncer)

### 7. Files Remaining in Root
- CLAUDE.md (updated with new structure)
- README.md (project readme)
- KNOWLEDGE_CONSOLIDATION_SUMMARY.md (this file)

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: All generic ShareDo knowledge is now in one place
2. **Reduced Duplication**: Consolidated duplicate information
3. **Cleaner Root**: Project root now only contains project-specific files
4. **Easier Navigation**: Clear folder structure for different knowledge domains
5. **AI Assistant Friendly**: Updated CLAUDE.md helps AI assistants find documentation

## Usage

- For ShareDo platform documentation: Check `Knowledge/` folder
- For project-specific documentation: Check component folders
- For external knowledge base: `C:\Users\IgorJericevich\Alterspective\Alterspective Knowledge Base - Documents\AI Knowledgebase\LearnSD\KB`

## Next Steps

When adding new ShareDo generic documentation:
1. Place in appropriate Knowledge subfolder
2. Update Knowledge/README.md
3. Keep project-specific docs in component folders
